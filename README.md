# Task Tracker in React
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 
And created following [Traversy Media's YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8).

It's a simple Task Tracker.
 
# How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice
 
Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not oo much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.
 
# Optimizations
(optional)*
 
You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but lso functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!
 
# Lessons Learned:
 
No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have hose *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
