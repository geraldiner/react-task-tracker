# Task Tracker in React
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 
And created following [Traversy Media's YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8).

It's a simple Task Tracker for listing tasks and reminders.
 
# How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

The app is built on React and JSON-server to simulate a backend server so that the data persists. Each part of the app is a component:

![Components of the app](https://i.imgur.com/UvWCVbT.png)

* Header
* Button
* Task
* Footer
* About 
 
Each of the components could be embedded in the other by importing them. Furthermore, you can pass along `props` that are used in the last component in the chain.
 
# Optimizations
Each part of the app is a component, which is what makes React so useful. You can reuse components, such as the Task component, which would take forever to write out by hand. And probably be really clunky if using VanillaJS.
 
# Lessons Learned:
 This is my first time working with React so it was kind of a lot to take in. 
No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have hose *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
